                        A 48 hour hackathon to design solutions to problems faced in fighting coronavirus in Latin America. I was motivated to take part because the demographics of Latin America and India are quite similar,.

                    <h2>Application Process</h2>
                    <p>
                        The process simply involved filling the application form which asked questions about you, your skills, language proficiency and your motivation to participate in the challenge. I was selected as one of 1500 from among 4000+ applicants from 73 countries.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                    <h4>Track A-Identifying the COVID-19 immune</h4>
                    <p>
                        Since the best strategy to fight COVID-19 is to identify cases and isolate them, we need to develop new and reliable methods to identify, test and trace patients with COVID-19 to prevent the spread of the virus. At the same time, we need to identify immunity status, as this would allow people to safely return to the workforce.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What new technologies can we use to achieve these goals? How can we manage the silent risk of unaware and asymptomatic infected people? How can we
                        estimate how many have been infected, identify them and locate them in a timely manner?
                    </p>

                    <br />

                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <h4>Idea pitches</h4>
                    <p>
                        Participants in a specific track could pitch their ideas and slack channels correspeonding to each idea were made. Then you could explore ideas, talk to people and figure out which one you were interested in being a part of. I really liked Carlos' idea
                        on connecting hospitals with discharged COVID patients since it seemed to be the only one which stuck to the problem statement proposed. Additionally, a lot of the news articles spoke about re-emerging hotspots in Beijing and South Korea, which I felt could have been avoided if patients were tracked for their immunity post being discharged from hospitals. Since my thought process was in alignment with his, I chose to join his team.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Team approach</h4>
                    <p>
                        We were a team of 6 with two engineers (Ara and me), two programmers (Juan and Alejandro), one designer (Dara) and one medical student (Team leader Carlos). Carlos already had already pitched an idea for the approach - which involved modifying the existing gold standard (PCR) for immunity testing by adding a third tier of testing. This new immunity test would be based on flow cytometry to identify T-Lymphocytes - and the best part was that the
                        equipment for the new test would be easily available in all tertiary hospitals since it was used in other tests. The basic protocol involved putting discharged patients in contact with the closest hospitals which could conduct the immunity test, and making a database of the same for use of government and health institutions.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Mentor Talks & Practice Pitches</h4>
                    <p>The best part was guidance from domain experts and practice pitches in front of these mentors. Mentors were doctors working on the front lines, researchers working on designing solutions and students from the MIT organising team. In each practice pitch we were given valuable inputs on improvement.</p>

                    <h2>My Role</h2>
                    <p>
                        My contribution to the team was its name - CoVmunity and identifying data sources that support our hypothesis and solution. The designer designed the UX while the programmers worked with AWS professionals to host the website.

                    <p>
                        The first prototype has been designed and was presented during the 3 minute final pitch.

                        There were some really amazing ideas that were presented in front of the judged, and hence we were extremely surprised when we won!

                    <h2>Experience and Future Scope</h2>
                    <p>
                        This was my first team project done completely online, and made me realise that despite the constraints, teamwork IS possible online. Tools like Slack, Zoom and Airtable are really useful for collaboration. The team plans to continue working on the project by working with a tertiary hospital in Mexico. Unfortunately, due to language barriers and time-zone restrictions I have been unable to continue contributing.
