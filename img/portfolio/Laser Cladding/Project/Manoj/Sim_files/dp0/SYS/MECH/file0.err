/COM,ANSYS RELEASE Release 18.1      BUILD 18.1      UP20170403       09:55:22

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.922   TIME= 09:55:24
 Using 1 iteration per substep may result in unconverged solutions for   
 nonlinear analysis and the program may not indicate divergence in this  
 case.  Check your results.                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.922   TIME= 09:55:24
 Temperature-dependent properties have not been specified.  The          
 THOPT,QUASI option does not perform equilibrium iterations.  Small      
 time steps may be required to obtain accurate results.                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.172   TIME= 09:55:25
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.781   TIME= 09:55:25
 Material number 29 (used by element 70989 ) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     140.188   TIME= 09:56:58
 Material number 29 (used by element 70989 ) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     336.531   TIME= 09:59:24
 Material number 29 (used by element 70989 ) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     544.469   TIME= 10:01:48
 Material number 29 (used by element 70989 ) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     770.500   TIME= 10:05:33
 During this session the elapsed time exceeds the CPU time by 33%.       
 Often this indicates either a lack of physical memory (RAM) required    
 to efficiently handle this simulation or it indicates a particularly    
 slow hard drive configuration.  This simulation can be expected to run  
 faster on identical hardware if additional RAM or a faster hard drive   
 configuration is made available.  For more details, please see the      
 ANSYS Performance Guide which is part of the ANSYS Help system.
