 USE A MAXIMUM OF     1 EQUILIBRIUM ITERATIONS EACH SUBSTEP

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.922   TIME= 09:55:24
 Using 1 iteration per substep may result in unconverged solutions for   
 nonlinear analysis and the program may not indicate divergence in this  
 case.  Check your results.

 DO NOT SAVE ANY RESTART FILES AT ALL

 DO NOT COMBINE ELEMENT MATRIX FILES (.emat) AFTER DISTRIBUTED PARALLEL SOLUTION

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     770.500   TIME= 10:05:33
 During this session the elapsed time exceeds the CPU time by 33%.       
 Often this indicates either a lack of physical memory (RAM) required    
 to efficiently handle this simulation or it indicates a particularly    
 slow hard drive configuration.  This simulation can be expected to run  
 faster on identical hardware if additional RAM or a faster hard drive   
 configuration is made available.  For more details, please see the      
 ANSYS Performance Guide which is part of the ANSYS Help system.
